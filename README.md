# Taskmaster-pro
 A task-management application which was built using jQuery, a third-party JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, and the front-end CSS library Bootstrap.
 Taskmaster incorporates third-party libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap. These libraries don't replace regular JavaScript and CSS; instead, they add new methods and classes that expedite development
 
## Tools used for this web app:

Bootstrap is an open source responsive front-end component library for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. It uses a responsive grid system to allow for quick layouts in both development and production.

jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in the world. It simplifies DOM traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation with an easy-to-use API.

jQuery UI is a set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery library, providing features such as drag and drop functionality and a date picker.

jQuery UI Touch Punch is a small library that enables the use of touch events on sites using the jQuery UI library. This allows developers to use jQuery UI to create interfaces for mobile and touch devices.

Moment.js is an open source JavaScript library that removes the need to use the native JavaScript Date object directly, making the Date object easier to parse, validate, and display.

Google Fonts is a library of over 900 free licensed fonts, with an API for conveniently adding the fonts to your web application.

Open Iconic is an open source icon font set that can help add meaning to elements of your website. 

### skills aquired building this app:

   - Learn to consult documentation when faced with new libraries.
   - Traverse and manipulate the DOM using jQuery methods.
   - Attach delegated browser events to elements with jQuery methods.
   - Implement a better user experience with focus and blur events.
   - Practice other applications of this to distinguish between clicked elements.
    
jQuery provides shorter methods to find and manipulate DOM elements, add event listeners, and perform other common JavaScript-related tasks. Plain JavaScript can do everything jQuery does, but many developers find the jQuery syntax easier to remember and type.
